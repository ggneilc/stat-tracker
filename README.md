# You.GG
*Tracking your own stats to turn life into a Video Game!*

You.GG Aims to be a Self-Improvement tracking app designed to be an All-in-One (AIO) Fitness App.

## Design Philosophy

The Primary Goal: Use the same tools that video games/social media are using to create a fun app that pushes you to be productive, rather than be harmful.

How it achieves this:
- Be able to easily record Meals, Workouts, Water intake, and hours Slept
- Feel rewarded for entering in data
- Serotonin inducing homescreen that shows your overall sense of progress
- Fun animations that induce dopamine (you want to enter more data = you have to go out and do things!)

## Tech Stack and Resources

This app is meant to start off as a test of using Golang as the backend:

- React Fronted
- Golang Backend
    - GoFiber for Express.js like API
    - GORM for object relational mapping to database
- Postgres / mysql database (indecisive rn)
