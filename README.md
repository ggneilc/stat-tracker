# You.GG
*Tracking your own stats to turn life into a Video Game!*

You.GG Aims to be a Self-Improvement tracking app designed to be an All-in-One (AIO) Fitness App.

## Design Philosophy

The Primary Goal: Use the same tools that video games/social media are using to create a fun app that pushes you to be productive, rather than be harmful.

How it achieves this:
- Be able to easily record Meals, Workouts, Water intake, and hours Slept
- Feel rewarded for entering in data
- Serotonin inducing homescreen that shows your overall sense of progress
- Fun animations that induce dopamine (you want to enter more data = you have to go out and do things!)

as well as having in depth analytics about yourself, similar to a website like [This](https://u.gg/lol/profile/na1/loltyler1/overview).
